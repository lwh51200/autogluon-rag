"""Structured evidence for the agentic RAG path.

The standard retriever returns plain text chunks. The agentic path needs
structured evidence so it can support citation, verification, trace export, and
debugging. ``Evidence`` wraps a single retrieved chunk with its provenance and
scoring metadata; ``EvidenceStore`` collects evidence for one query and
deduplicates it by document/chunk identity.

class Evidence:

    Attributes:
    ----------
    evidence_id : str
        Stable reference for citations and trace (assigned by ``EvidenceStore``).
    text : str
        Retrieved chunk content.
    retrieval_query : str
        The query that surfaced this evidence (may differ from the user query
        when subqueries or rewrites are used).
    rank : int
        Position of this chunk within the results for ``retrieval_query``.
        Enables ordering and debugging.
    doc_id : Optional[int]
        Source document identifier. Used for deduplication and provenance.
    chunk_id : Optional[int]
        Source chunk identifier within the document.
    source : Optional[str]
        Document path, URL, or file name. May be ``None`` until ingest-time
        metadata is extended to carry provenance.
    retrieval_score : Optional[float]
        Similarity score from the vector database, if exposed.
    rerank_score : Optional[float]
        Score from the reranker, if a reranker was used.
    rrf_score : Optional[float]
        Fused Reciprocal Rank Fusion score, when the evidence came from fused
        (hybrid / multi-query) retrieval.
    fusion_rank : Optional[int]
        Position of this evidence in the fused ranking (0-indexed).
    retrieval_queries : List[str]
        Every query/subgoal that surfaced this chunk. Preserves full multi-query
        provenance even after dedup (``retrieval_query`` holds the first).
    tool_name : Optional[str]
        Name of the tool that produced this evidence. Supports traceability.
    used_in_answer : bool
        Whether this evidence was cited in the final answer. Supports citation
        precision and verifier output.
    metadata : Dict[str, Any]
        Any additional raw metadata carried from the vector database record.
